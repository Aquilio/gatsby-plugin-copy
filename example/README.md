# Gatsby Copy Example

Copies an `env.txt` file into the `public` folder from the `env` folder depending on the `ENV_FILE` environment variable.

`yarn run build` will copy `env/default.txt`
`ENV_FILE yarn run build` will copy `env/production.txt`

To view the site use `yarn run serve` and visit `http://localhost:9000`.
